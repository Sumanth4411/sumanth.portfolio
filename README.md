#Descrption:
Welcome to my professional portfolio, a showcase of my journey as a passionate and dedicated web developer. This platform is designed to reflect not just my technical skills, but also my commitment to continuous learning and growth. Here, you'll find detailed sections highlighting my expertise in front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. Each section represents hours of effort, practice, and real-world implementation.

My projects demonstrate practical applications of responsive design, user-friendly interfaces, and clean coding principles. You can explore the badges and certifications I’ve earned, which validate my learning in areas like Generative AI, Machine Learning, and web technologies. These badges aren’t just graphics — they represent milestones in my professional development.

The internship and experience sections provide insight into the real-world roles I’ve undertaken, along with the responsibilities and skills I’ve gained. I also include my academic achievements and key learnings from coursework and online platforms.

The "Hire Me" section is a direct invitation to collaborate — whether you’re a recruiter, startup founder, or fellow developer looking for a teammate. This website is fully responsive and built using the latest web development practices to ensure a smooth and modern user experience across all devices.
